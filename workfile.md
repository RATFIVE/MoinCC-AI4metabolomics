## Questions

### technical background
- How are the spectra produced? Difference MRI MRS? Different frequencies emitted or only different frequences "returned"?

### about the data

- What are the audiofiles?
  
---
- what is the goal of the project? --> identificatuion and quantification(via integral)? --> identification just via range of peaks?

- physical reason for measurement, e.g. resonance frequency/ is identification peak dependent(or =) on reference frequency? (is reference frequency = exciting frequency)

- Why not use NMRQN, what are the differences? Why not just the existing models. For example BATMAN
- 
---
- (Why ppm on x axis? shouldn't it be the frequency? What is chemical shift?(because y= intensity))
--> relative shift of reference frequency, what is reference frequency?
  
- what are characterististic curves/values? --> labeled data
    - (file Data_description.xlsx feature ppm ? ) if multiple values, multiple                   
     states of same metabolite?--> ranges for metabolics ?
    - in data, there are four peaks only three labels in data description (marco, Tom explain)
    - 
    - what are possible shifts? what are they caused by and how are they recognized?
    - do water peaks need to be taken into account?

- Fatima said she is calculating integrals. What integrals? what is she doing? -> Further Quantification


  (- what is a healthy spectrum?? not labeling peaks but abnormalities)

## possibly interesting keywords (with info)
- Markov Chain Monte carlo algorithm ( what is it? mentioned in several papers)
- stochastic hill climbing algorithm (-:-)
- streamlit for visualization ( recommended by Marco)
