# Automated MRI Spectra Metabolite Detector
Analyzing an organism's metabolism is crucial for understanding and monitoring diseases and treatments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only technique to measure the metabolism noninvasively, in vivo, and in vitro.

## Goal 
The goal of this project is to create an application which automatically measures the abundance of metabolotites in measured spectra. The substances are specified in a metadatafile.

## Set up the Application
The application uses python....
