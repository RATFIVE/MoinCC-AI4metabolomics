The files like FA_20240206_2H_yeast_acetone-d6.csv

The first row contain IDs (PPM, and spec IDs from 1 to the end)
The first column is X axis,
The followin columns are spectra as a function of time.

Data_description.xlsx file contain all file ids provided and time between spectra acquisition.
The spectra are averaged NS times, with repetition TR and the time between middle of spectra is TR*NS which is provided in Data_description.xlsx.

The data sets have been modified. In each set, the first spectrum's water (HDO) peak has been positioned at 4.7 ppm. This serves as a reference point. In subsequent spectra, if the water peak moves away from 4.7 ppm, it indicates that the pH is changing over time.
